# Dodecapod-Parallel-Manipulator

This repository showcases a redesigned Stewart Gough parallel manipulator called as the Dodecapod. The project involves mathematical modelling and workspace analysis of the Dodecapod.

##Background

Parallel manipulators, known for their superior characteristics and dynamic capabilities, have their fair share of short comings such as limited workspace and singularities within the workspace. Incorporating redundancy in the design of parallel manipulators increases their chances of overcoming these shortcomings. This work presents a novel recunfigurable Dodecapod type parallel manipulator, inspired by the popular Stewart-Gough platform. 
- The kinematics of the Dodecapod is showcased. 
- Validation of the derived kinematic formulations is presented Through motion simulation of the manipulator. 
- The variable workspace offered by the manipulator is shown through plots.
