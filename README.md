# Dodecapod-Parallel-Manipulator

This repository showcases a redesigned Stewart Gough parallel manipulator called as the Dodecapod. The project involves mathematical modelling and workspace analysis of the Dodecapod.

## Background

Parallel manipulators, known for their superior characteristics and dynamic capabilities, have their fair share of short comings such as limited workspace and singularities within the workspace. Incorporating redundancy in the design of parallel manipulators increases their chances of overcoming these shortcomings. This work presents a novel recunfigurable Dodecapod type parallel manipulator, inspired by the popular Stewart-Gough platform. The Dodecapod is shown to have a few advantages over the Stewart-Gough platform in terms of variable workspace, singularity avoidance and improved dexterity.

## The main components showcased in the Repo are :
- Kinematics of the Dodecapod. 
- Validation of the derived kinematic formulations through motion simulation of the manipulator. 
- Variable workspace offered by the Dodecapod is shown through plots.
